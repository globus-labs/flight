"""
This module implements several functions that can be used to create `FederatedDataset` objects. These are used
to do local simulations (or remote simulations) with benchmark Machine Learning datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
More specifically, this module aims to make it easy to launch FL experiments with different statistical data
distributions.
